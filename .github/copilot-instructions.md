This project is a React-based Tic Tac Toe game where one player is the computer.
Focus on clean, modern UI and simple AI for the computer player.
Use functional components and hooks where possible.

Maintain all styles to a styles folder and share common styles to a single file for consistency.
Separate styles for each ui element (e.g., buttons, inputs) to ensure reusability.

If a file grows more than 200 lines, consider splitting it into smaller components.
